# web-server

The home for my node.js/express based weather application. 

The application uses geocoding from the Mapbox api, and gets its weather information from the Weatherstack API.  I used this project to get my feet wet with a well-used JS based
backend, andto learn more about actually using a server to deliver a webpage.  

The frontend isn't complete, though it's passable for now.  I'm working to sharpen my frontend skills to make the app more aesthetically pleasing and modern.
